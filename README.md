# Master_Mind_Game
This program is an exercise in object oriented design in ruby, as a part of the a curriculum from The Odin Project.

So far, this program is a working command line version of the board game Mastermind, which you can read about here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)

You can play the game a code maker or code breaker against an A.I. so far. Or, you can watch two A.I.'s play against each other.

Eventually, I will change the code to allow the user to choose the number of digits used in the code, as well as the "base" of the number system, which is currently 1 through 6.
